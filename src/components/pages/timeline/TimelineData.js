Different sceneries and sentiments in the surrounding are enough to encourage the cameraman to frame them. This project has helped the people to take photos suitable for a storygram. A kid, fruit-sellers, animals, roads, shelters, people, that means anything or anybody can contribute in the storygram. Storygram really makes the soul of a reader cherished by reading such heart-touching posts.",
