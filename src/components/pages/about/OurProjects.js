          Every picture has a story behind it! The picture shows its emotions
          through telling its unique story. A photographer is the one who knows
          each and every chapter of the photograph he takes. "Storygram" is a
          project of Junoon that admires clicking pictures that describe a
          story. It is just a random capturing of certain moments that are
          converted into a story. Different sceneries and sentiments in the
          surrounding are enough to encourage the cameraman to frame them. This
          project has helped the people to take photos suitable for a storygram.
          A kid, fruit-sellers, animals, roads, shelters, people, that means
          anything or anybody can contribute in the storygram. Storygram really
          makes the soul of a reader cherished by reading such heart-touching
          posts.
