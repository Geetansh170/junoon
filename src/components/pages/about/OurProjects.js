          Every picture has a story behind it! The picture shows its emotions
          through telling its unique story. A photographer is the one who knows
          each and every chapter of the photograph he takes. "Storygram" is a
          project of Junoon that admires clicking pictures that describe a
          story. It is just a random capturing of certain moments that are
          converted into a story. Different sceneries and sentiments in the
          surrounding are enough to encourage the cameraman to frame them. This
          project has helped the people to take photos suitable for a storygram.
          A kid, fruit-sellers, animals, roads, shelters, people, that means
          anything or anybody can contribute in the storygram. Storygram really
          makes the soul of a reader cherished by reading such heart-touching
          posts.

          An eye of the photographer can see the weirdest things in an
          impressive fashion! The cameraman is always in a search of such
          moments. One of the amazing projects of Junoon is "Project
          Perspective" which is completely based on this theme. This gives you
          the freedom of clicking anything that may be real or illusionistic but
          it should blow the mind of the viewers by its creativity. You can find
          imaginativeness anywhere in this big sphere. To admire the scene in a
          different perspective all you need is to grope flora-fauna,
          architecture, monuments, people and many more things. This project has
          been going on for many years. People in Junoon have always come out
          with their unexpected innovativeness followed by their super skills in
          photography.

          York, Humans of NSUT is for all the people who contribute directly or
