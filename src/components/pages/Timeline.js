It is just a random capturing of certain moments that are converted into a story. Different sceneries and sentiments in the surrounding are enough to encourage the cameraman to frame them. This project has helped the people to take photos suitable for a storygram. A kid, fruit-sellers, animals, roads, shelters, people, that means anything or anybody can contribute in the storygram. Storygram really makes the soul of a reader cherished by reading such heart-touching posts."

This gives you the freedom of clicking anything that may be real or illusionistic but it should blow the mind of the viewers by its creativity. You can find imaginativeness anywhere in this big sphere. To admire the scene in a different perspective all you need is to grope flora-fauna, architecture, monuments, people and many more things. This project has been going on for many years. People in Junoon have always come out with their unexpected innovativeness followed by their super skills in photography."
